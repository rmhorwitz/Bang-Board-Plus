# Bang-Board-Plus
Bang Board Plus is a USB virtual pinball interface that provides a game joystick controller, a HID keyboard, and a handful of outputs.  The game joystick input is replaced with the X and Y output of an accelerometer, while the joystick Z channel emmulates the output of a ball plunger.  The board has 12 high-current output channels for controlling solenoids, motors and lamps.  This is a value point system, providing a limited amout of features at a low cost.
The coding was initially done in micropython, but may be ported to C++ for increased performance. Initial release will not include any software coding, as this will be added later.
The schematic and PCB design is captured in KiCAD 8.0. 
PDFs of the PCB and schematics are provided for review.
