# Bang-Board-Plus
Bang Board Plus is a USB virtual pinball interface that provides a game joystick controller, a HID keyboard, and a handful of outputs.  The game joystick input is replaced with the X and Y output of an accelerometer, while the joystick Z channel emmulates the output of a ball plunger.  The board has 12 high-current output channels for controlling solenoids, motors and lamps.  This is a value point system, providing a limited amout of features at a low cost. 
Coding was initially done in micropython, but this had severe performance restrictions. MJR offered a JSON script for his Pinscape for Pico that I have edited and tested. This JSON script is included in this package.  For more information about MJR's Pinscape Pico, go to his GitHub page at https://github.com/mjrgh/PinscapePico. 
The schematic and PCB design is captured in KiCAD 8.0.  This package stands at Revision 2.
Built PCBAs have been tested and evaluated with no issues to report. This package is released as-is.  Please Enjoy!
